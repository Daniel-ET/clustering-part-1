# clustering-part-1

The aim of this notebook is to explore clustering.

We will use the Iris flower dataset. The Iris flower fataset is a classic dataset used to identify types of flowers based on features describing their petals. We will load the dataset directly from the scikit-learn machine learning library.

After loading the dataset, we will extract two of the attributes and will run the K-means algorithm to obtain 3 clusters
